# Intro-to-Javascript

We have now completed HTML & CSS now we will be diving into Javascript. During my 3 year study at varsity college i have already leanrned javascript, but i could use a refresher.
We will be macking notes of all the sections here and be doing week 0 - week 1 today.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Week 0 
Overview:
-JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It is what gives a page life - the interactive elements and animations that engage the user. If you've ever used a search box on a home page, checked a live sports score on a news site, or watch a video, it has likely been produced by JavaScript.

-JavaScript is one of the three pillars of web development - the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript was purposely designed to integrate into HTML. All major web browsers support JavaScript, though most give users the option of disabling support for it.

Learning Journey:
- As JS is a higher-level programming language and because the basics of programming are important skills to have, we will spend Week 1 and Week 2 purely on understanding and familiarizing ourselves with JavaScript. In subsequent weeks, we will learn more advanced classes of JavaScript that will help us develop the front-end (ReactJS) and the back-end (ExpressJS) of websites.
- we will look at how 4 modules where week 1-2 will be an intro to javascript, week 3- 5 will be font-end and week 6-8 will be on Expressjs.

# Week 1 Basic syntax
Day 1: JavaScript 1: Variables, Operators & Assignments

Javascript Basics
- Javascript gives the website functionalality and makes certain buttons work. If javascript was disabled then the web or any mobile app functions would not work properly and people would see a bunch of funny
  things happen.
- Variable is to define a statment and assign the called variable a function.
- To increment operator adds one to the operand and returns a value. To do that you add x++ ( returns value before incrementing) or ++x (returns value after incrementing).
- To decrement operator u need to subtract the operand and return a value. To do that you subtract x--(retuns value before decrement) or --x (returns a value after a decrement).

Variables:
- JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as an object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.
- JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
- Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

The day 1 of java is over and i have completed all exercises.
