# Intro-to-Javascript

We have now completed HTML & CSS now we will be diving into Javascript. During my 3 year study at varsity college i have already leanrned javascript, but i could use a refresher.
We will be macking notes of all the sections here and be doing week 0 - week 1 today.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Week 0 
Overview:
-JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It is what gives a page life - the interactive elements and animations that engage the user. If you've ever used a search box on a home page, checked a live sports score on a news site, or watch a video, it has likely been produced by JavaScript.

-JavaScript is one of the three pillars of web development - the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript was purposely designed to integrate into HTML. All major web browsers support JavaScript, though most give users the option of disabling support for it.

Learning Journey:
- As JS is a higher-level programming language and because the basics of programming are important skills to have, we will spend Week 1 and Week 2 purely on understanding and familiarizing ourselves with JavaScript. In subsequent weeks, we will learn more advanced classes of JavaScript that will help us develop the front-end (ReactJS) and the back-end (ExpressJS) of websites.
- we will look at how 4 modules where week 1-2 will be an intro to javascript, week 3- 5 will be font-end and week 6-8 will be on Expressjs.

# Week 1 Basic syntax
Day 1: JavaScript 1: Variables, Operators & Assignments

Javascript Basics
- Javascript gives the website functionalality and makes certain buttons work. If javascript was disabled then the web or any mobile app functions would not work properly and people would see a bunch of funny
  things happen.
- Variable is to define a statment and assign the called variable a function.
- To increment operator adds one to the operand and returns a value. To do that you add x++ ( returns value before incrementing) or ++x (returns value after incrementing).
- To decrement operator u need to subtract the operand and return a value. To do that you subtract x--(retuns value before decrement) or --x (returns a value after a decrement).

Variables:
- JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as an object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.
- JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
- Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

The day 1 of java is over and i have completed all exercises.

Day 2: Today we begin with day 2 of javascript and we are learning strings and arrays today. Honestly i forgot arrays, because i hardly used them during my studies but they are really important for toring the data to the device, but the down side it only saves for that session unless u hard code the data in. In the first 2 tabs of the lesson they introduced us to what we will be learning and made us watch videos on how strings and arrays work.

Strings:
- A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.
- As strings are the way we display and work with text, and text is our main way of communicating and understanding through computers, strings are one of the most fundamental concepts of programming to be familiar with.

I was then given an activity about strings and to take screenshots and submit them. I have done that and now will be going into the array section. The strings activity was to easy and activity 2 with the arrays was really benefitial, learning alot from it. Day 2 is now complete and i will continue with my landing and webpage project for friday.

Day 3: Today i begin javascript day 3, i will be leanring functions today, once i am done with the functions i am going to continue with my landing page.
Notes:
- Always put ur script at the end of the body tag and never anywhere above, this is if you are running the script in an html file. You can create a seperate javascript file and link it to the html like how you would with CSS.
- You can have multiple javascript file and implent them in the html file but it will run the functions in order of the javascript files added to the html.
- Functions can be called more then once and they take argumants.
- Arguments make code reusable.

Functions:
- A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
- Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

Day 3 of javascript is now complete and i will now be focusing on the landing page.

Day 4 of javascript has now begun and i am doing this chapter early so i can focus on my landing page and power point. In day 4 i will be learning booleans.

Booleans:
- Booleans are values that can be only one of two things: true or false.
- Anything “on” or “off,” “yes” or “no,” or temporary is a usually good fit for a boolean. It’s useful to store booleans in variables to keep track of their values and change them over time.
- if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
- The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

day 4 is now complete and i will now continue with my landing page.
Day 5 of Javascript. Today i will be doing a sprint for day 5, reviwing all the activities and things i have leaned in the past 5 days.
